# Loan-Approval-Analysis-PowerBI
# US/Canada Loan Approval & Credit Risk Engine

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a hypothetical **US & Canada-based loan portfolio**. The goal was to create a **Credit Risk Model**.

By analysing borrower demographics (FICO scores, DTI, Income) against loan performance, this dashboard identifies high-risk segments and evaluates the portfolio's profitability under different economic scenarios.

## Key Features & Analysis

This project involved a full end-to-end Power BI implementation, including:

* **Data Transformation:** Cleaned and standardised multi-national datasets (US/Canada), handled null values, and performed currency normalisation.
<br>

* **Data Modeling:** Implemented a Star Schema to optimise performance for credit risk calculations.
<br>

* **DAX Measures:** Developed custom measures for **Default Rates**, **Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC)**, and **Loss Given Default (LGD)**.
<br>

* **Interactive Analytics:** Utilised bookmarks for scenario switching and tooltips for granular borrower profiles.
