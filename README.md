# Loan-Approval-Analysis-PowerBI
# US/Canada Loan Approval & Credit Risk Engine

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a hypothetical **US & Canada-based loan portfolio**. The goal was to create a **Credit Risk Model**.

By analysing borrower demographics (FICO scores, DTI, Income) against loan performance, this dashboard identifies high-risk segments and evaluates the portfolio's profitability under different economic scenarios.
